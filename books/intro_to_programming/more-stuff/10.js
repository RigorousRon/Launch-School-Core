/*
This exercise has nothing to do with this chapter. Instead, it uses concepts you learned earlier in the book. If you can't figure out the answer, don't worry: this question can stump developers with more experience than you have.

Consider this code:

> let x = "5"
> x = x + 1
= "51"

Now, consider this code:

> let y = "5"
> y++

What gets returned by y++ in the second snippet, and why?

number 5 gets returns. string gets coerced back to a number and y gets incrementd by 1
