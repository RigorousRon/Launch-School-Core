// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

console.log(greeting);

var greeting = 'Hello world!';

// Using var hoists the variable to the beginning of the scope, so it initialized, but not set to a value yet, so the console.log(greeting) returns undefined
